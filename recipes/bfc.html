                <li>½ cup fresh parsley leaves</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughlychopped</li>
                <li>1 serrano chile, seeds removed androughly chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>

                <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly groundblack pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425. Rinse the chicken well, then dry it with paper towel. Season the chicken aggressively with salt. Combine the remaining dry ingredients in a small bowl, and rub the mixture all over the skin of the chicken breasts.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large, oven-safe sauté pan or skillet set over medium heat. When it is shimmering, put the breasts into the pan skin side down, and cook, unattended, until the skin is golden brown, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Using tongs, turn the chicken breasts over, and place the pan in the oven. Roast until the chicken is golden brown all over and the meat cooked entirely through, approximately 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the chicken to a warmed platter, and allow to rest.</li>    
                <li>Meanwhile, put the mint, parsley, garlic and serrano into a food processor, and pulse into a paste. Add the honey and mustard, and pulse again, until combined. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until the mixture has become emulsified. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, and if necessary, whisk in a few tablespoons of water to thin the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Spoon some of the sauce over each chicken breast, and serve, with the remaining sauce on the side. Roasted potatoes with some thinly sliced lemons makes a fine accompaniment, along with sautéed greens.</li>
            </ol>
