        <p>These Mexican wedding cookies are tender, delicate, and full of rich, buttery pecan flavor. Dusted in powdered sugar, they're a perfect holiday treat.</p>
        <p>My family has them at every christmas celebration and they are my favorite cookie overall.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 heaping cup pecans</li>
            <li>1¼ cups powdered sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        </ul> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium skillet over low heat, toast the pecans for about 5 minutes, until fragrant. Transfer the nuts to a food processor and pulse to form a coarse meal.</li>
            <li>Measure ¾ cup of the powdered sugar into a medium bowl and set aside for rolling.</li>
            <li>In another medium bowl, mix together the flour and the cinnamon.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter, the remaining ½ cup powdered sugar, and the salt until light and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla and almond extracts. Gradually add the flour mixture and then the pecans and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Use a 1-tablespoon cookie scoop to scoop the dough. Then, use your hands to roll it into balls and place them on the baking sheets. If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the fridge for 30 minutes before rolling.</li>
            <li>Bake for 13 to 16 minutes, until just golden. Let cool on the baking sheets for 15 minutes, then roll the warm cookies in the reserved powdered sugar.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
